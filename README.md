# ADS124S08
Very simplistic and stripped down Particle Photon/Electron library for the TI chip ADS124S08 (and similar). This MAY work with other Arduino-esque microcontrollers, but it's not tested with anything other than the Particle platform.

My primary goal was to work with PT100 temperature sensors, so when that was successful I stopped developing the library. Feel free to fork and take it further with more examples and features.
